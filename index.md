From February 2014 to February 2015, I collaborated with the Marine Biology Lab at Woods Hole, USA, to study cuttlefish, an invertebrate marine animal related to octopus and squid, from the perspective of neuroscience. My primary goal was to learn about their behaviour, how to take care of them, and how to modify our lab’s behaviour experiment setups for rats to work with cuttlefish.

During this time, I learned a lot about arduinos and cameras and how to film sea creatures. I took care of cuttlefish in all stages of their life cycle and even developed unique relationships with individuals.

Many thanks to Kendra Buresch, Stephen Senft, Alex Schnell, Andrew Carvey, Arthur Petron, Troy McInerney, Kelsey Cramer, Corinne Cramer, Andrea Rummell, George Bell, Alan Kuzirian, Barbara Burbank, Lyda Harris, Dan Calzarette, and Roger T Hanlon for their support and assistance at Woods Hole during this project. Additional thanks to Adam Kampff and the Intelligent Systems lab for enabling and supporting this collaboration.

## Want to learn more?

Visit [my online open lab notebook](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/) to see [my on-going documentation of the Cuttle Shuttle project](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/). 

The software used to run the experiment can be found in ????. 

Documentation of the analysis work on the Cuttle Shuttle dataset can be found in [the Cuttle Shuttle Analysis github repository](https://github.com/everymind/CuttleShuttle-Analysis).

## Want to get involved?

Interested in helping us analyze the videos in the Cuttle Shuttle dataset? 

- Help us annotate the videos! We want to mark several "moments-of-interest", such as body pattern changes in response to the prey, tentacle shots, tentacle "peeks", and moments of [deimatic behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimatic_behaviour). We also want to mark the location of the cuttlefish in order to help computers learn how to detect cuttlefish in the face of camouflage behaviour. 
- Interested in teaching a computer how to detect camouflaging animals? Use our annotated dataset to train or test your machine learning algorithm, python OpenCV code, or Bonsai workflow, then share your results!
- Are you a field scientist or avid marine filmographer? Share your videos of cuttlefish in the wild to help us validate our laboratory findings!

Interested in discussing the premises and hypotheses underlying this project? We are looking for input on the following questions:

- Why do cuttlefish make the "tentacle shot pattern"?
- How much can we read about the cuttlefish nervous system just by looking at their skin, given the tight coupling between neurons and chromatophores?
- What is a brain? What is a nervous system? 
- How do we know when something is intelligent, or at least acting intelligently?
- How do cuttlefish see?

If you have any other questions you want to talk about, or if you have other ideas for understanding this dataset, [I would love to hear from you!](mailto:danbee@alum.mit.edu)
